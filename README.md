# Smart Parking System Project

I led the development of an IoT-based Smart Parking System aimed at efficiently managing parking spaces and enhancing user experience. This system utilized advanced sensor technologies and microcontrollers to automate parking space monitoring and facilitate real-time updates for users.

## Key Features:

- **Parking Slot Management:** Implemented a system to monitor and manage available parking slots in real-time. Integrated proximity sensors to detect incoming and outgoing vehicles.
  
- **LED Display Integration:** Integrated LED displays at the entry point of the parking lot to provide clear indications of available parking spaces. The display dynamically updated to reflect the current status of the parking lot, indicating the number of available slots or displaying a "Slot Full" message when all slots were occupied.

- **LCD Feedback:** Employed Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) to provide additional feedback within the parking area. The LCD displayed the current count of available parking slots, offering instant information to users.

- **Light Sensing:** Integrated Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to detect ambient light conditions. When the light level dropped below a specified threshold, indicating dim lighting conditions, an LED was automatically illuminated to enhance visibility within the parking area.

- **Servo Control:** Utilized servo motors to control the barrier gate, allowing for automated opening and closing based on vehicle presence and slot availability.

## Technologies Used:

- **Arduino:** Leveraged Arduino microcontrollers for sensor interfacing, data processing, and actuator control.
  
- **ESP32:** Employed ESP32 microcontrollers for their Wi-Fi capabilities, facilitating seamless communication between devices and enabling remote monitoring and control.

- **C++ Programming:** Developed firmware using C++ programming language to implement system logic and device interactions.

- **Wireless Communication:** Utilized Wi-Fi protocols for wireless communication between IoT devices, enabling real-time data exchange and system updates.
